                    <h2 class="h2">Key Features:</h2>
                    <li><strong>Sales Operations:</strong> Salespeople sell cars to customers, and each car is associated with a single salesperson and customer. Invoices are generated per transaction, ensuring accurate record-keeping.</li>
                    <li><strong>Customer Service:</strong> Customers can have their cars serviced at the dealership, even without purchasing a car. Service tickets are generated for each car brought in, and detailed service history is maintained.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mechanic Assignment:</strong> Multiple mechanics can work on a car, and each mechanic can handle multiple cars. The system tracks service work and the parts used during the repair.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <ul>
                    <h2 class="h2">Technologies Used:</h2>
                    <li><strong>Backend:</strong> PHP handles the core logic of the system, processing requests such as sales, customer management, and service tracking.</li>
                    <li><strong>Database:</strong> MySQL stores all data related to sales, customers, cars, service tickets, and more, ensuring that the system runs smoothly with efficient data management.</li>
                    <li><strong>Frontend:</strong> HTML, CSS, and JavaScript form the user interface, making the system interactive and easy to use.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <ul>
                    <h2 class="h2">Project Documentation:</h2>
                    <li>ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) and DFD (Data Flow Diagram) are provided to illustrate how data moves through the system and how various entities are related.</li>
                    <li>README.md includes detailed setup instructions, prerequisites, software dependencies, and deployment steps for the system.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                <h2 class="h2">Delivery and Submission:</h2>
                <p>The prototype is developed and hosted in a GitHub repository, where the latest version of the codebase is always available in the default branch. Final submissions will be made via GitHub Pull Request.</p>
